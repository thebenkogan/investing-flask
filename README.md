# Group Investing App

Made with Python, Flask, and Bootstrap 5.

Allows users to make accounts, start groups, invite other users to those groups, and invest in stocks together. Uses web scraping to get the current stock price of each investment, returning accurate data for the group's total balance and each individual's share.
